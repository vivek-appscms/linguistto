      "question": "What is the difference between summarizing & paraphrasing?",
      "answer": "It's important to remember that paraphrasing is not the same as summing up summarising. When you give an overview of a subject or when you give an overview of the primary ideas of an author as a whole, you are presenting a summary. It is common for a summary to be significantly shorter than the original content, and it may be possible to summarise the main points of a paragraph in one sentence. Paraphrasing is the process of rewriting a passage from a source document in your own words. A paraphrase, on the other hand, is a reduced version of the original, whereas summarising keeps the original's length intact."
    },
    {
      "question": "Is paraphrasing illegal?",
      "answer": "Paraphrasing in scholarly papers must be noted as a professional courtesy, even though it is not prohibited by law. By 'documenting' or 'citing' your sources, you are giving credit to the author of the material (terms which mean you credit your source). Using words that are too similar to the original material's terminology, or even the sentence structure of the paraphrased text will appear as though you are attempting to pass off someone else's content as your own. Copying is unethical and in certain circumstances illegal, as evidenced by the fact that this is done. The arabic paraphrasing tool gives you control over the legibility and quality of your article.
