      "answer": "It's important to remember that text rewriting is not the same as summing up summarising. When you give an overview of a subject or when you give an overview of the primary ideas of an author as a whole, you are presenting a summary. It is common for a summary to be significantly shorter than the original content, and it may be possible to summarise the main points of a paragraph in one sentence. text rewriting is the process of rewriting a passage from a source document in your own words. A text rewriter, on the other hand, is a reduced version of the original, whereas summarising keeps the original's length intact.\n"
