What is the easiest approach to convert an English document to Amharic for free?

**Google Translate (#1)**

Google Translate is the world's most well-known machine translation service. Those who have used it in the past may recall how horrible it used to be, but Google Translate has vastly improved with the introduction of numerous new technological improvements (including Google Neural Machine Translation (GNMT) on top of it all).

Not everyone is aware that you can use Google Translate to translate complete papers. The following file formats are supported:.doc,.docx,.odf,.pdf,.ppt,.pptx,.ps,.rtf,.txt,.xls, and.xlsx.

Click the Contribute a Better Translation link when hovering over a line of the translation. Click Contribute after typing your translation into the text box. Google Translate has received your translation.

**Deepl Translator (#2)**

Deepl is a service that launched in late 2017 and instantly drew industry notice. The service accepts.docx and.pptx files.

To translate a document, go to Tools and then Document Translation.

Original and translated copy

While the translation is generally adequate for conveying the intended information, it is crucial to note that it is not flawless. It's best to have a native or fluent speaker review the paper if you need a precise translation.

**Linking Within a Document**

Creating a link to a heading

Headings are typically used at the start of a section, and you may link to them in just a few steps. Take a look at our Text Styles course to learn more about generating headings.

**Bookmarking a page**

What if you wish to connect to a specific part of your work, such as a statistic or important fact? Bookmarks can be used practically anywhere, whether on a blank area, a block of text, or an image.

**To make a bookmark in Google Docs, follow these steps:**
