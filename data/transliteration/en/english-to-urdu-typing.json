      "question": "What does transliteration mean?",
      "answer": "The term 'transliteration' refers to the process of transforming text written in one script to another script. Using this English to Urdu transliteration online tool, you can enter in Latin letters (e.g. a, b, c, and so on) that are translated to characters that have a comparable pronunciation in the target language. Transliteration, for example, can be used to convert a phrase written in the Greek script into a phrase written in the Latin alphabet. Keep in mind that the phrase will not be translated, but will instead be changed to the Latin script. It is important to note that 'transliteration' is not the same as 'translation' in that the conversion is dependent on the pronunciation rather than the meaning."

      "question": "Why you should use this English to Urdu transliteration online tool?",
      "answer": "In many cases, English speakers have difficulty deciphering characters from different alphabets. Translation prioritizes pronunciation over meaning, which is especially useful when addressing foreign people, places, and cultures because it allows for more accurate pronunciation. As a result, if you need to read the material in another language but are more concerned with how it is pronounced than with how it is understood, transliteration is required. However, if you want to understand what it means, you'll need translation services. For example, a person may not recognize the word 'party' written in '[X]', but they may recognize it when written in English letters, 'party' <br>Because many smartphones and cell phones do not support certain alphabets, sending a text message in a foreign format may result in a poor user experience.

Text typed in Unicode can be read on all computers without the need to install any additional software. Unicode characters can use only one byte, or up to four bytes, despite the fact that it is commonly thought to be a two-byte coding system. A code point is a one-of-a-kind number for a character or symbol, such as an accent mark or ligature. Unicode supports over a million code points, which are represented by a 'U' followed by a plus sign and the number in hex; for example, the word 'Hello' is represented by U+0048 U+0065 U+006C U+006C U+006F. As a result, it is always recommended to type Urdu in Unicode. The English to Urdu transliteration online tool generates Unicode text.

    },
    {
      "question": "What is the difference between transcription and transliteration?",
      "answer": "When characters from one language are translated into characters from another, they are pronounced in the target language. This is called transcription. As a result, different rules can be used for the same source language depending on the target language (e.g., German or English). The transcription has the advantage of allowing everyone who speaks the target language to correctly read the converted words of the source language. One disadvantage is that transcription is not always easily inverted. For example, the Text Converter supports Cyrillic transcription rules for English and German.<br>On the other hand, when using transliteration, each character of the source language is assigned to a different unique character of the target language, allowing for an exact inversion to be achieved. It is possible to use a combination of characters (for example, KA for Hiragana) and diacritic (for example, for Cyrillic) when the source language contains more characters than the target language. Despite the fact that the pronunciation is not as important in transliteration as it is in transcription, it is often possible to recognize the pronunciation by the character that was used. Some ISO transliterations are supported by the Text Converter, including Cyrillic-Latin (ISO 9), Arabic-Latin (ISO 233), Hebrew-Latin (ISO 259), Greek-Latin (ISO 843), Japanese-Latin (ISO 3602), Georgic-Latin (ISO 9984), and Thai-Latin (ISO 11940).<br>As a result, the distinction between transcription and transliteration is that transcription reflects the phonetic articulation of words, whereas transliteration does not. Transliteration, on the other hand, is used when a word is transferred from one writing system to another. In the transcription, the Arabic word كتب for books is 'kataba' and in the transliteration, it is 'ktb'."
