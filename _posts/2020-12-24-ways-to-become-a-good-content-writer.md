In simple words, content writing is all about wordplay. If you are someone who writes content that is reader friendly, creative and engaging, then you are a good content writer. For example, a new fashion designer has just launched her new website. If she wishes to showcase her distinction in the field and business, she will be doing so by producing content on her website that showcases her skills. Here the content will show her brand to the audience. Being a content writer comes with great perks. Depending on the nature of your work you have the incredible flexibility to either work from home or from office. But the job is not easy in nature and one must inculcate certain skills in order to be a published writer. As a content writer you will have to come with innovative ideas and the work could be anything from writing content for websites, blogs, technical or research papers. Before you take a pen, paper or even a laptop, you must know that writing great content is just not about writing what comes on your mind but generating content based on knowledge. Now that I have captured your attention let us take a look at what it takes to don the hat of a content writer.

**Here are seven skills sets one must emulate in order to become an unmatched writer.**

1\.Adaptibility

This might seem pretty obvious, but I have seen a lot of content that falls short of its task. It fails to engross the audience. For example, landing pages of a website should contain copy that is short and designed to persuade the reader to take action. Regarding tone, blog posts for a scientific equipment company targeting medical researchers will likely be much different from posts for an organic food shop targeting a wider range of health-conscious consumers. The more styles you adapt to the more adapted writer you become.

2\.Research skills

Good research skills is the best way to generate high quality content. It is also important to find and include content only from trustworthy and reliable website and sources.

3\.Good understanding of SEO

Good content writers stay on top with SEO trends. It is important to understand how to craft SEO friendly titles and keywords thus keeping up with the latest Google trends.

4\.Organizational skills

Keeping a calendar and knowing your deadlines is always the efficient and effective way. Turning on an important assignment late always sends a bad message to your clients. Prioritize your tasks and get them done promptly.

5\.Staying focused

Writing is a creative action and requires constant focus. Therefore when you initiate a writing task make sure to remove all possible distractions from you side.

6\.Communication

There could be tasks given to you that you are unfamiliar with. In order to deliver quality content it is important to communicate effectively with your clients and understand what they need from you.

7\.Editing

First drafts are rarely perfect. Therefore in order to have a polished content one must be patient, disciplined with eye for detail to sieve all errors from the content before sending it for publishing.

**Now let’s understand the nitty gritty of how to become a good content writer.**
