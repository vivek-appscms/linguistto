Expression of your thoughts is critical when writing academic papers and essays.

By creating a relationship between sentences and paragraphs, transitions serve as a link between the concepts expressed in a work. Transitional words, in simple terms, allow a reader to shift from one idea to the next. They support and contribute in the creation of a bridge between the thoughts.

Consider someone who abruptly switches the topics in the middle of a conversation. They rapidly shift to the other subject without ending the present topic of conversation. It is obvious that you will be puzzled in this situation and may become frustrated or irritated. The same is true when it comes to writing a document.

Each paragraph delivers and displays a separate idea in essay writing, academic papers or literally every piece of textual content such as blogs, letters, emails etc. As a result, when one paragraph i.e., thought ends, the next one must have a link to the prior one, and the transition between them must be seamless. Transitional words and phrases are particularly important in this situation.

Good examples of contrasting transition words and phrases are first, then, later, afterward, suddenly, at this point, a few days later, therefore, nevertheless, however, and so on.

Absent of contrasting transitional words and phrases, the reader becomes perplexed when the material distracts him or her from the original point that was made. As a result, the overall goal of the writing assignment, whether to persuade or educate the audience, is defeated. If you are a student, using transitional words and phrases might help you get a good grade on your essay writing assignment because the reader will be able to understand your essay completely and even grasp the primary ideas expressed in it. In case of professionals, this will help them be more expressive and articulate in your communications. For bloggers, it is said that use of appropriate transition words has a positive effect on the its SEO score.

When a writing fails to specify when a new point is being examined in order to further support the essay's main subject, the reader is unable to recognize that a transition has occurred and continues to evaluate only the prior point. When an author makes use of transitional words and phrases, however, everything becomes evident as soon as a new topic is introduced. As a result, transitional words and phrases are critical, particularly in academic papers and essay writing assignments.
