## **Using appropriate transition words in sentences**

Transitional words and phrases help make a piece of writing flow better and connect one idea to the next. These words make your text easier to read and understand. These words are like, **‘But’, ‘So’, ‘And’ & ‘Because’, etc.** Transition words make your sentences better to understand. When you put your thoughts and ideas into sentences and use transition words in between, it actually helps your text flow more readable.

However. Based on the type of transition you want to make. Transition words are divided into various categories. It may be possible that one transition has several other words, but not necessarily the same meaning because there's more than one way to connect ideas, there are many types of transitional phrases to show a variety of relationships. 

Moreover, Using transition words in your writing can help you enhance the readability of your content. These words help your text flow and show readers the relationship between phrases and paragraphs. But what are they exactly? Why are they so important? And how should you use them? View several examples of transitional words and phrases used in sentences.

**What are transitional words and phrases?**

The most basic used transitional words or conjunctions that we often use are, "and," "but" and "or" to connect two sentences together. Let us see some familiar examples to understand how these words are used:

1\.I ran to the park, and I just got there on time.

2\.I ran to the park but was still late. As you can see in the examples above, even simple conjunctions serve different purposes.

* The first sentence uses "and" as a transition word that connects the two occurrences equally.
* The second sentence uses "but," which introduces a contrast.

  Knowing what kind of transition words to use comes in handy and helps you to get your point across. These words show the relationship between the phrases, paragraphs, and sentences that we write. Using this kind of word makes it easier to read our texts and understand them in a better manner. Let us see some examples to understand this better:

  I pushed the domino. As a result, it fell over.

  When you start a sentence with ‘as a result, your reader will immediately know two things:
  1. What happened in the first sentence caused something;
  2. The second sentence is going to describe the effect.

     By using the phrase ‘as a result here, you show that the two separate sentences are part of one process. Without reading the whole sentence, your potential reader can well in advance guess what is likely to come next. We can also say that these transition words are like a glue that holds our sentences together. With them, the individual parts come together to form one whole. Transition words don’t always have to be placed at the beginning of a sentence. Consider the following example.

     Harsil is a very nice guy. He took us out to dinner yesterday, for instance.

     In this example, ‘for instance, is placed at the end of the sentence. Nonetheless, it still provides the reader with information as to how the two sentences are related.

     I enjoy his company because he always tells interesting stories.

     In this example, ‘because’ doesn’t connect two sentences, but two clauses. Transition words can connect anything from short phrases to entire paragraphs.

     Adverb transition words - Other transition words are adverbs that describe the way an action is performed or how it relates to another idea. For example:
     * I went to the waterpark **after** he gave me my paycheck.
     * Bowling is a sport in which the player with the highest score wins. **Conversely**, the goal in golf is to get the lowest score.
     * to get the lowest score.

     **Understanding transition words using everyday examples**

     **Text A**

     I’m going to discuss a few reasons why practice is important to learning skills. The only way to truly master a skill is by actually doing what you’ll have to do in the real world. I think practice can be a fun way of putting in the necessary hours. There are some people who will disagree. It is said that people tend to remember only 10-20% of what they’ve heard or read. That number rises to as much as 90% when you put theory to practice. Following up an explanation with practice is key to mastering a skill.

     **Text B**

     **In this paragraph**, I’m going to discuss a few reasons why practice is important to mastering skills. **Firstly**, the only way to truly learn a skill is by actually doing what you’ll have to do in the real world. **Secondly**, I think practice can be a fun way of putting in the necessary hours. There are, **however**, some people who will disagree. **Thirdly**, and **most importantly**, it is said that people tend to remember only 10-20% of what they read or hear. **Moreover**, that number rises to as much as 90% when you put theory to practice. **In conclusion**, following up explanation with practice is key to mastering a skill.

     Text A though not a bad paragraph lacks the finesse of Text B. ext B does a better job of showing there are three separate arguments to support the statement with a definite conclusion. Readers are going to be more intrigued while reading Text B as compared to the contents in Text A as the latter explains in a better manner.

     **Tricks to improve: smooth experience in transition writing**

     Creating a smooth writing experience is like maintaining a bicycle chain. When your chain gets muddy, it starts to squeak and rattle. Pedaling becomes harder. And perhaps the chain might even drop off. In order to have a smooth riding experience, you first remove the dirt from your chain, and then apply lubricant to reduce friction and prevent rust. When editing your content, you do exactly the same. First, you remove the dirt from your content—you eliminate unwanted words and replace weak words. And then you apply writer’s lube—which is the transitional tricks for a smooth reading experience.

     **Transition trick #1:** Drops of light oil

     Much the same as drops of oil make your bike chain move without friction, transitional words make readers glide through your content.

     Transitional words make the reading experience smoother since they clarify the connection between two sentences. Instances of temporary words are:
     * And
     * But
     * Or
     * However
     * In contrast
     * Because
     * For instance
     * So

     You can either use transitional words at the beginning of a sentence to explain the relation with a previous sentence or to connect two parts of one sentence. Here’s an example:

     She has ideas to share, but nobody listens

     Sometimes, you want to shout, Hey you listen!

     Now read these sentences aloud and you will notice how abrupt these phrases are. Your writing requires little variation in order to sound interesting. Now let us remove the transitional words and read again.

     She has ideas to share. nobody listens

     You want to shout, Hey you listen!

     **Transition trick #2:** Like changing gears. Yes, just like in cycling, in writing you often move up or down a gear. For instance, in your introductory paragraph, you've explained to your reader that you have understood the problem and will aim to solve it. To indicate the start of the section with tips, use a short and engaging question:

     Are you ready to get started?

     Does this sound good?

     Shall we begin?

     Therefore, addressing your readers with short questions makes your content conversational and engaging, and it encourages your readers to read on.

     **Transition trick #3**

     A few years ago, I bought a new bicycle. But each time I cycled uphill and changed gears, the chain fell off. To sort out this chain frustration, I now have a rubber dog fang. The dog fang prevents the chain from falling off. Similarly, we need such dog fangs in our writing too.

     Keep your reader intrigued with short phrases like:

     Let me explain why

     And now comes the best part

     Not only that

     What’s more

     Even more importantly

     **Transition trick #4:** The Connectors

     The secret involved in successfully moving from topic to topic without losing your readers or listeners is word connectors. Word connectors are words that are repeated subsequently in many sentences.

     A coke quenches your thirst and appears to give energy, but its nutritional value is low. A fruit smoothie sounds healthy but may have a ton of added sweeteners.

     Similarly, words with low nutritional value will seem to have a meaning, but their meaning is not quite strong.

     Therefore, repeating a variation of the phrase “low nutritional value” helps readers move to the next topic.

     **Transition trick #5:** Using Pronouns

     Pronouns (words like they, it, he, her) play a similar role as word connectors, but you have to be careful what or whom the pronoun refers to.

     For example, The kid was angry with her mother because of her ice cream. Instead, let us try to write, The kid was angry because she had only one scoop of ice cream, and her mother took three scoops. Ambiguity confuses readers and makes them stop to consider your message. Hence we should be clear so that our readers glide through the text effortlessly.

     **Transition trick #6**

     Bicyclists can argue for hours about the best way to keep your bike chain free from rust. Use Tri-flow. Use light oil. Re-lube more often. Hence, your content also needs a mix of tricks for the smoothest reading experience.

     Make sure your subheading arouses curiosity or promises a benefit for the readers. When your reader’s mind starts to wander off, a startling subhead intrigues him back. It encourages people to keep reading and move on to the next topic with great agility.

     **Transition words play a crucial role in building your text. Transition words or phrases help the reader to understand the relationship between one idea to the next. It indicates exceptions, comparisons, examples, and sequences. You also need to use transition words properly for better understanding.

     3. **Know-How To apply Transition words**- Having knowledge of transition with the proper idea of applying it makes it more valuable.

     5. **Use Logical Transitions**- Every transition word has its unique meaning. Improper Knowledge of transition words and using them in a sentence can change its meaning and confuse your point that you want to understand your reader.

     **Conclusion**
