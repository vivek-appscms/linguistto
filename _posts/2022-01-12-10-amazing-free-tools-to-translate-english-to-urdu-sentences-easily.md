Urdu is a widely spoken language. This language is spoken by more over 70 million people worldwide. It may be tough to translate Urdu to English for those who do not speak the Urdu language. For a few dollars, many websites offer Urdu translation services. While paying for large amounts of text (such as books and papers) and professional service is a fine concept, it is pointless to pay for often used sentences, greeting messages, and other informal uses. Hence English to Urdu translation tools can be used for various purposes.

**What is the Purpose of Looking for a Google Translate Alternative?**

Here are some reasons why you should use a translator other than Google Translate, to help you make a better informed decision.

1\. Only a limited number of file types are supported by Google Translate.

Do you require InDesign files to be translated? Is it possible to use scanned PDF files? Do you wish to spend your time copying and pasting content into a Word document for a certain type of translation?

Google Translate, on the other hand, does not enable such sluggish and costly transformations. As a result, certain Google Translate alternatives can assist you in maintaining your formatting while converting it during the translation process.

2\. It is not possible to customise Google Translate translations.

Although Google Translate is free and simple to use, its functionality is severely limited due to the algorithm's design.

With Google Translate, you get exactly what you provide. You won't be able to adjust the automated translation engine or change any of the translated content or speed.

3\. Google Translate Isn't a Business Solution

Google Translate is a fantastic tool for tourists and personal use, however it lacks a translation editor and does not allow for user contribution.

Some Google Translate alternatives include company-level security and features to make translations go faster and smoother. They also assist you in making considerable financial savings.

4\. The Information You Provide to Google Translate Isn't Secure

Did you know that by using Google Translate for any form of translation, you are granting Google permission to store, publish, and share your text?

While this may be acceptable if you're a traveller looking for caf√© menu items or a venue to go sight-seeing. However, it can cause problems for anyone working with personal or protected data, particularly corporations or anyone dealing with legally sensitive information.

Alternatives to Google Translate can be far more reliable, adaptable, and secure, with more features and capabilities.

And, to save you the trouble of finding the finest one, we've compiled a list of the top 10 Google Translate alternatives. So, let's get started!

1. Contenttool.io - English to Urdu sentence translation

The English to Urdu Translation Tool is powered by the Google Translation API. Start typing in the left-hand text area, then use the drop-down option to select "Translate." The application then translates your English word, phrase, or sentence into Urdu.

It simply takes a few seconds to translate and can handle up to 500 characters in a single request. Although this translation isn't flawless, it may give you a good idea of what's going on, and with a few modifications, it can be rather accurate. Google developers are constantly working to increase the accuracy and intelligence of Urdu translation algorithms. Hopefully, one day, it will be able to offer near-perfect translations!
