There are dozens of languages spoken in Africa. Indigenous languages, pidgins, and creoles are among them. There are also a few daughter languages from the colonial period that are still spoken in the area. People in every country speak more than one vernacular due to ethnic and linguistic variety. Ethiopia's situation is no different. Amharic is the country's official language and lingua franca. However, Oromo, Somali, and Harari are spoken by a substantial number of people. The vernaculars have affected Amharic since they are frequently in contact with each other.

What is the easiest approach to convert an English document to Amharic for free?

**Google Translate (#1)**

Google Translate is the world's most well-known machine translation service. Those who have used it in the past may recall how horrible it used to be, but Google Translate has vastly improved with the introduction of numerous new technological improvements (including Google Neural Machine Translation (GNMT) on top of it all).

Not everyone is aware that you can use Google Translate to translate complete papers. The following file formats are supported:.doc,.docx,.odf,.pdf,.ppt,.pptx,.ps,.rtf,.txt,.xls, and.xlsx.

While the translation is generally adequate for conveying the intended information, it is crucial to note that it is not flawless. It's best to have a native or fluent speaker review the paper if you need a precise translation.

**Linking Within a Document**
