## **How to use transition words for paragraphs**

**Definition**

A transitional paragraph is a paragraph in an essay, speech, composition, or report that signals a shift from one section, idea, or approach to another. Usually, in a short sentence, a transitional paragraph is most commonly used to summarize the ideas of one part of a text in preparation for the beginning of another part.

**Bridging Paragraphs**

"Many writing teachers use the analogy that transitional paragraphs are like bridges: the first section of the essay is one riverbank; the second section is the other riverbank; the transitional paragraph, like a bridge, links them."(Randy Devillez, Writing: Step by Step, 10th ed. Kendall/Hunt, 2003)

**Functions of Transitional Paragraphs**

The transitional paragraphs come into use when we write long essays. Such a paragraph can summarize what has been written. It may hint at what is to be expected by our inquisitive readers who read further on.

Powerful section changes sign to perusers how two successive passages identify with one another. The transition flags the connection between the "new data" and the "old data." For instance, the new passage may 

expound on the thought introduced in the former passage

present a connected thought

proceed with a sequential story

depict an issue with the thought introduced in the first passage

depict an exemption for the thought introduced in the former section

depict a result or ramifications of the thought introduced in the first passage

depict a result or ramifications of the thought introduced in the first passage

We should think about a couple of models (drawn from distributed books and articles of passage advances that work. The models beneath replicate section endings and openings. Focus on how each passage opening signs to readers how the section identifies with the one they have quite recently completed the process of perusing. Observe the loss in clarity when transitional signals are removed.

**Examples of Transitional Paragraphs**

Example 1

Paragraph ending -Once his system was applied to all acts of manual labor, Taylor assured his followers, it would bring about a restructuring not only of industry but of society, creating a utopia of perfect efficiency.

Paragraph Opening with transitional cues - Taylor’s system is still very much with us; it remains the ethic of industrial manufacturing.

Paragraph opening without transitional cues - Taylor’s system is the ethic of present-day industrial manufacturing.

The transitional sentence signals that the new paragraph will seek to demonstrate that the phenomenon described in the preceding paragraph (Taylorism) is ongoing: it is “still” with us and “remains” the dominant workplace ethic. Compare this sentence with the one directly beneath it (“paragraph opening without transitional cues”). With this version, readers are left on their own to figure out the connection.

Example 2:

Paragraph Ending- If the story concerns social crisis or disorder, more frequently than not this response will come from sources of official authority: the police quell the rioting, labor, and management leaders reach an agreement, the State Department approves or condemns the latest coup d’état in South America. The press in this way establishes a subtle relation between narrative order and the perception or representation of political order.

Paragraph opening with transitional cues - Todd Gitlin makes a similar point in commenting on the “orderliness” of television news.

Paragraph opening without transitional cues - Todd Gitlin comments on the “orderliness” of television news.

The transitional sentence signals that the new paragraph will further explore the idea expressed in the earlier paragraph. The phrase “makes a similar point” signals towards this relationship. Without this transitional phrase, the connection between the two paragraphs can still be understood but it is not quite clear. The above examples illustrate, effective paragraph transitions signal relationships between paragraphs.

Let us look at some terms that are often helpful for signaling relationships among ideas.
