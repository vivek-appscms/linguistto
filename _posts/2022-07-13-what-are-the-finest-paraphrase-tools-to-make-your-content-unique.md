Students are tempted to use a paraphrasing tool at this point. A **paraphrasing tool** is a software that is used to rewrite an expression without plagiarism; it assists a writer in writing an author's idea differently; by mostly replacing the original writing with synonyms while still conveying the original author's idea. This process is also known as essay spinning.

**FAQ’s**

**Ques 1 - What distinguishes summarising from paraphrasing?**

Ans - It's critical to keep in mind that paraphrasing differs from summarising. You are delivering a summary when you provide an overview of a topic or when you provide an outline of all of an author's major ideas. A summary is frequently much shorter than the original text, and it might even be able to condense a paragraph's major ideas into a single sentence. The act of reworking a passage from a source text in your own words is known as paraphrasing. Contrarily, a paraphrase condenses the original while a summary maintains the full length of the original.

**Ques 2 - What are the advantages of using this English paraphrase tool for teachers and students, and why?**

Ans - Students also have trouble paraphrasing and revising. Despite their best efforts, they are unable to fully convey the core of the issue. When writing these, they take great care to prevent plagiarism. Additionally, it is a waste of their time, and it might not even live up to student expectations. As a result, they lose motivation. Lesson and student note planning can be challenging for teachers. Both the teacher and the students can benefit from using our tool for paraphrasing in English. Teachers can give a variety of writing activities to assist students to develop their writing skills as well as their vocabulary and grammatical skills.

**Ques 3 - How can I paraphrase better?**

Ans - Read the original material numerous times to make sure you comprehend its essential themes. Write down and memorize the most crucial information. To make sure your work is accurate, compare it to the original. Take the original concepts and create something fresh with them. It is simple to determine if someone has copied from a textbook because it is so evident. You'll have to get used to your writing style being distinct from the authors you're reading. Look for more precise words once you've determined what the original text was trying to communicate. However, the paraphrased version should keep these terms since they are essential to the content of the sentence.
