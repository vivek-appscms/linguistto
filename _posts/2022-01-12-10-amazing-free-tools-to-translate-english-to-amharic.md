There are dozens of languages spoken in Africa. Indigenous languages, pidgins, and creoles are among them. There are also a few daughter languages from the colonial period that are still spoken in the area. People in every country speak more than one vernacular due to ethnic and linguistic variety. Ethiopia's situation is no different. Amharic is the country's official language and lingua franca. However, Oromo, Somali, and Harari are spoken by a substantial number of people. The vernaculars have affected Amharic since they are frequently in contact with each other.

It's written in the Ge'ez writing system. Because there is no commonly accepted method of Romanizing Amharic, linguists utilize a variety of ways when transcribing it in the Latin alphabet. Amharic is a very essential vernacular since it keeps Ethiopians unified, despite the fact that it does not have millions of speakers.
